            Over the years, we’ve crafted and shaped thousands of videos. We
            have a tried-and-tested process that enables our clients to grow
            their brands and us to keep delivering on-point and on-time. Here’s
            a look at our cloud-based workflow for on-demand video services.
            (Note: our process for strategic, long-term video engagements are
            slightly different to this.)

          <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold">1. Project Briefing</h3>
          <p>
            We start by understanding your business objectives, target audience,
            and key messages. Our Client Servicing team collaborates closely
            with you to outline project goals, ensuring a clear and actionable
            direction from the start.

          <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold">2. Research & Insights</h3>
          <p>
            Before diving into the creative process, we do our own research and
            understand the brief as well as the context. This ensures that our
            solutions align with your business goals and resonate with your
            target audience.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold">3. Concepts & Estimates</h3>
          <p>
            We develop and present a couple of creative concepts and estimate
            options for your brief, to help you choose the most suitable way
            forward.

          <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold">4. Copy & Design</h3>
          <p>
            Our creative team works on copy and design to bring our unique
            concept to life. For videos, this includes scripting, visualisation,
            graphic design, music research, mood boards, location scouting,
            curated crews, styling and more.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold">5. Execution / Production</h3>
          <p>
            From one-camera testimonial videos at an office to a series of
            videos produced across 5 countries - we support videos across
            formats, locations and at any scales. For projects that don’t
            require a live shoot, we go from design to post production, and
            deliver the initial draft. We then refine the draft video based on
            your feedback, delivering a final product that aligns perfectly with
            the business intent and brand aesthetics.

            6. Video Post-Production & Versioning
          </h3>
          <p>
            We manage the entire post production process — from editing,
            animation, sound design to audio mixing and mastering and colour
            grading – ensuring quality consistency across all creative assets.
            We also handle video versioning supporting custom adaptations
            requirements so that your content is tailored to engage your
            audience across mediums.
          </p>

          <h3 className="mt-4 font-semibold">7. Asset Delivery</h3>
          <p>
            All final creative assets are uploaded to our technology platform,
            ensuring easy access, downloads and repurposing for your brand.
