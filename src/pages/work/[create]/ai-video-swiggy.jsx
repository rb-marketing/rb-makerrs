                                Swiggy’s InsanelyGood app was created to deliver premium, fresh groceries with a focus on quality and curation. One of its standout offerings was a collection of single-origin coffees from regions like Coorg, Wayanad, and Nepal.

                                The brief was to create a 15-second ad film that highlighted the provenance of these coffees and drove app downloads. But there was a challenge built into the brief: how do you take the audience across different geographies, capture the sensory richness of each origin, and do it all in a short, cost-efficient format?

                                This challenge called for a solution that could deliver cinematic richness without heavy production overheads. That’s where GenAI-first production came in. By generating the coffee landscapes entirely with AI tools, we could bring alive diverse origins - from the misty hills of Nepal to the lush estates of Coorg and Wayanad - without the cost and complexity of location shoots.

                                That shift to GenAI also opened up a creative opportunity: if we could stage these origins so seamlessly, why not use it to transport the audience straight to the places their coffee comes from?
                            </p>
                            <p className="text-base md:text-2xl text-rb-black/80 !leading-[150%] leading-7 mb-[30px]">
                                We built the story around a single, human anchor: a coffee mug in hand. Intimate and relatable, it became the perfect device to carry viewers across multiple AI-crafted backdrops. 
                                With every shift of the mug, the world behind it changed - from Nepal’s misty hills to Coorg’s lush plantations to Wayanad’s bold estates. This let us compress the sensory richness of provenance into a sharp 15-second format, while showcasing AI’s ability to create immersive, cinematic landscapes at speed.
                            </p>

                                To complete the experience, the voice-over was AI-generated, bringing consistency and speed to the process, while the supers were crafted and added manually to reinforce clarity and emphasis. This hybrid method gave us both efficiency and control - delivering a film that felt transportive, premium, and digitally native.

                                The result was a 15-second AI-powered film that solved the brief with both creativity and efficiency. By combining a strong conceptual idea with AI-driven execution, we could achieve cinematic storytelling without heavy production overheads.
