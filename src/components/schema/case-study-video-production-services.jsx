            "text": "As experts who have produced hundreds of B2B case study videos across industries, geographies and video formats - with every new brief, we’re always on the lookout to try something new. This has helped us come up with a tried-and-tested process that enables us to deliver impactful case study videos for your brand. Our typical workflow starts with a clear brief, followed by research, concepts, script, design, production, post-production, reviews, and versioning. But what’s unique about how we do it, is our proprietary platform that facilitates efficient cloud-based workflows. Here’s a quick run-through of how it helps:\n\n- Your brief is loaded on our platform. This contains all the information you&apos;ve shared, everything we&apos;ve dug up, and all the creative assets we need to work on. Everything is in one place.\n\n- We use rate cards, add-ons, and an efficient costing tool on our platform to speed up the pricing and contract process for you.\n\n- We propose a narrative structure with one or more creative approaches that align with your industry, audience, tone, and brand identity. You can choose what resonates most with your brand and marketing needs.\n\n- Our project managers draft the most optimal project schedule on our platform, setting milestones that work best for your requirements. Everyone on the project knows exactly when something is due to you, no follow-ups required.\n\n- The creative team gets going with their work, coming to you for reviews at the script and storyboard, or design stages.\n\n- Our producers coordinate all logistics - scheduling interviews, sharing prep material, confirming availability, and curating and managing professional on-ground crews.\n\n- Files, links, and updates are all on the cloud, so you and your colleagues are never left wondering what&apos;s next or how things are progressing.\n\n- Once the post-production team gets going with their work, video drafts are uploaded directly to the platform where you use our interactive review feature to share frame-accurate comments and respond to our creative suggestions - all without lengthy email chains or missed feedback. Additionally, all video drafts on the project are accessible to you on one dashboard, so you won’t have to hunt for links to compare notes.\n\n- Once the project is complete, your video assets are uploaded to our platform. Everything is neatly organised, downloadable, and shareable with colleagues and partners, and ready for repurposing in the future.\n\nOur cloud-based platform-led workflow allows us to maintain creative excellence while delivering at speed and scale. It also gives you an efficient and transparent experience from start to finish."

          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "We always request your brand guidelines at the start of the project and seek an understanding of your business, products, and solutions. This includes guidelines around tone of voice, visual styles, colors, fonts, logo usage, and reading material on your offerings. Our creative teams refer to these throughout the duration of the project to maintain consistency. We also align voiceover tone, music, subtitles, and animation style with your overall brand personality, message, and audience. The final result is a case study video that doesn’t just tell a successful and impressive story - it also feels unmistakably yours, wherever it’s posted."

        "acceptedAnswer": {
          "@type": "Answer",
          "text": "Yes, we frequently work with brands looking to create a suite of case study videos across geographies, products/services, or verticals. In such cases, we establish a visual and narrative framework upfront that ensures consistency, while allowing each video to reflect the unique customer and outcome. We also set up scalable production plans, centralised asset sharing, and a review process that’s easy to manage with colleagues and with client-side stakeholders. Whether you need three videos or fifteen, no matter how many locations, our professional processes help you roll out case study videos efficiently, without compromising on quality. We also work on projects where we design complete creative campaigns for lead generation, which include case study videos. This involves a unique, central campaign idea, designing a complete campaign plan, and supporting you with creatives required across the campaign, be they well-constructed webpages, LinkedIn banners, or videos."
