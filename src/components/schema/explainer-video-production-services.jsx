            "text": "Over the years, we have scripted, designed and produced hundreds of explainer videos across industries such as SAAS, technology, manufacturing, logistics, education and more. And while on every project we ask ourselves what we might do differently, and what we might do better – we also follow a tried-and-tested process that enables our clients to grow their brands and us to keep delivering on-point, on-quality. Our typical project workflow is something that starts with a clear brief, moves on to research, concepts, script, visualisation, design, storyboards, post production, reviews and versioning. But what’s unique about how we do it, is our proprietary platform that facilitates efficient cloud-based workflows. Here’s a quick run through of how it helps:\n\n- Your brief is loaded on our platform: this contains all the information you give us, we dig up, and all the creative assets we need to work on. Everything is in one place.\n\n- We use rate cards, add-ons and an efficient costing tool on our platform to speed up the pricing and contract process for you.\n\n- A great creative team is assigned to your project and briefed in detail.\n\n- Our producers choose the most optimal schedule on our platform, and update the dates as per your requirement. This way, everyone on the project knows exactly when something is due to you.\n\n- The creative team gets going with their work, coming to you for reviews at the script, storyboard or design stage.\n\n- We deliver the draft video on our platform and make it easy for you to review videos using our interactive review feature.\n\n- Once done, all the project assets are also uploaded to our platform so you can find them anytime you need and even share them with colleagues."
