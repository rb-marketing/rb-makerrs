    acceptedAnswer: {
      "@type": "Answer",
      text: "There are several ways in which we ensure quality consistency across locations. These include a detailed shoot brief that defines everything from camera, lighting, and sound requirements to framing and colour temperatures; our Producers being actively involved at the time of the shoot to ensure location access, check framing, lighting, etc; and, for more complex projects, we have a Director or two onboard the project to guide every crew and ensure the output is consistent across locations."
